### ZSH Theme

[Breakpoint ZSH](https://github.com/RoeelCohen/Breakpoint-themes/releases/latest/download/Breakpoint.zsh-theme) 
<br>
**This will change the terminal CLI itself, not it's colors.**
<br>
Inspired by ZSH default theme ([robbyrussell](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/robbyrussell.zsh-theme)).
This theme will let you know when is the next event of Breakpoint. Additionaly like the default theme, it'll let you know if you're working with a clean/dirty git brnach.
